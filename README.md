Description: A crystal collectors game in which the user's main goal of the game is to try to match their score to a randomly generated number. 

They increase their score points by clicking crystal buttons that add a random number value each time when clicked. If their total score becomes equal to the random number, the user wins. However, if their total score surpasses the random number, the user loses. After the game is over, the game resets and the user can replay again.
